## TO BE WORKED ON IN THE FUTURE:

While the battleship game is completely functional as of right now, I would like to get the synchronised nature of the turns to be fixed. I intend to come back in the future to refactor this code and begin implementing react in to it. Currently the code base is a bit of a mess which I will get around to refactoring also.

## Improvements to be added:

Create proper AI with the ability to link hits when a hit is sucessful.

Remove presets for the opponent board and instead create a function that generates a legal layout.

Refactor all the code as there is a lot of unneeded code currently.

The overall aesthetic could be better.

The timings aren't perfect.
